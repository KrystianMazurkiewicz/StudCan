# Practical-IT-project-demo

WORK IN PROGRESS...

SOMETIMES WHEN PRESSING BETWEEN TABS YOU CLICK DIFFERENT TAB AND IT DOESNT WORK, REFRESHES THE SAME TAB

SOMETIMES YOU CANT PRESS TAGS - THIS HAPPENS WHEN I PRESS AND DRAG MOUSE!

WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW INTERNSHIP THE STUDENTS CAN PUBLISH THEM AND THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
-- SO, WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW INTERNSHIP AND INVITE A STUDENT TO IT, GO FIRST TO ADMIN AND PUBLISH THE INTERNSHIP

YOU CAN SHOW INTEREST IN AN INTERNSHIP TWICE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE
-- SO, WHEN YOU PRESENT, DONT TRY TO SHOW INTEREST TWICE

This is a demo for a project in "Praktisk IT-prosjekt"-course

This project includes PHP, MySQL and CSS/HTML.

The image below is a screenshot from the working index.php page.

Forking the project will not work. To make it work you need to have PHP installed, as well as MySQL and Apache. You also need a database with two tables, "internships" and "tags". More info about about those tables is to be found in the source code of index.php.
