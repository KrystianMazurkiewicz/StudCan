# Practical-IT-project-demo

WORK IN PROGRESS...

This is a demo for a project in "Praktisk IT-prosjekt"-course

This project includes PHP, MySQL and CSS/HTML.

The image below is a screenshot from the working index.php page.

Forking the project will not work. To make it work you need to have PHP installed, as well as MySQL and Apache. You also need a database with two tables, "internships" and "tags". More info about about those tables is to be found in the source code of index.php.
